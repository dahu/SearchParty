_Enhanced searches, highlights and matches for Vim_

TIP: If you like SearchParty and want to share the W00t!, I'm grateful for

Visual Searches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* +*+  Searches for the next occurrence of the currently selected visual text.
       +<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindNext+

* +#+  Searches for the prior occurrence of the currently selected visual text.
       +<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindPrior+

* +&+  Starts a +:substitute+ using the currently selected visual text.
       +<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindSubstitute+

Literal Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* +<leader>/+   Prompts for a literal string to search for. This does
                NOT use a regular expression, so the characters you type
                here will be searched for literally without any magic
                interpretation. The +<Up>+ key scrolls through prior
                literal search history.
                +<Plug>SearchPartyFindLiteral+

Ranged Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    7,12 RSearch foo

Searches for "foo" only within the range from lines 7 through 12, both
inclusive. The default range is % (the whole buffer).

Multiple Replacements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* +<leader>mp+  Prompts for a Search Term and then prompts for
                Replacement Terms (space separated). The current line is
                then duplicated as many times as there are replacements,
                minus one, and the Search Term is then replaced on each
                line with each successive Replacement.

Search Highlight Replace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* +<leader>mar+ Prompts for a Search Term and a Replace Term and
                whether you want to use global replacement. The
                currently highlighted search terms will then have
                Search Term replaced with Replace Term. This map works
                in normal mode on the current line and in visual mode
                on the range given. There is a corresponding command:
+
    :[range] SearchHighlightReplace

NOTE: This feature is experimental and may not work properly or may
have adverse side effects. Please contact the plugin developer if you
experience any grief with this feature.

Search Highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* +<C-L>+       Temporarily clears search highlight.
                +<Plug>SearchPartyHighlightClear+

* +<C-BSlash>+  Toggles search highlighting.
                +<Plug>SearchPartyHighlightToggle+

* +<leader>*+   Highlights all occurrences of +word+ under the cursor.
                +<Plug>SearchPartyHighlightWord+

* +<leader>mah+ Toggle automatic highlight of all occurrences of +word+
                under cursor.
                NOTE: Update delay determined by +'updatetime'+
                +<Plug>SearchPartyToggleAutoHighlightWord+

* +<leader>g*+  Highlights all occurrences of +WORD+ under the cursor.
                +<Plug>SearchPartyHighlightWORD+

Highlighting Print Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

E.g.:

    :g/something/P

Will show the matching lines with all occurrences of `something` on those
lines highlighted.

Set Search
~~~~~~~~~~

* +<leader>ms+  Prompts for a pattern and sets the current search to
                that pattern without moving the cursor to the next
                match of that pattern.
                +<Plug>SearchPartySetSearch+

Matches
~~~~~~~

* +<leader>mm+  Prompts for a pattern and uses +matchadd()+ to highlight all
                occurrences of that pattern in the current window.
                +<Plug>SearchPartySetMatch+
+
There are six match patterns available, called +SPM1+-+SPM6+ respectively.
Using more than six matches will recycle through the SPM set, losing
the previous match assigned to that slot.
+
By default, the terminal palette colours #1-#6 are used for +SPM1+-+SPM6+.
You can override these by providing lines like this in your +~/.vimrc+ file:
+
  hi SPM1 ctermbg=123
+
NOTE: Do this after you have set your colorscheme.

The following functions and commands are available for Search Party matches:

* +SearchPartyMatchDelete(number)+ - clear match by number
* +SearchPartyMatchList+ - list all match patterns
* +SearchPartyMatchNumber(number)+ - reset match number (+1-6+)

M.A.S.H.
~~~~~~~~

Mash is a motion activated (lol - er, I mean, when you press ++n/N/\#/\*/g#/g*++)
current search match highlighter. Breaking that down for you, it highlights
the match under the cursor differently to all the other matches (if you have
:set hlsearch activated). If you don't use hlsearch, then it will still
highlight the current match.

SearchParty's MASH now plays nice with
